# My Scrum team

## Multiple personas

### Speaker Notes

"I mentioned earlier that one of the profound shifts in this new workflow is collaborating with a **team of AI personas**, not a monolith. This is what that team looks like.

Just like a real Scrum team, each persona has a specialized role. We have Logos, our Strategist, who focuses on logic and structure. We have Pathos, our Storyteller, who connects with the audience. And we have Scribe, our Documentarian, who ensures everything is organized.

By using System Prompts to activate a specific persona for a specific task, we are not just talking to a generalist AI. We are partnering with a specialist who is purpose-built for the job at hand.

This is the team we provide context to. And when a specialist on our team has the right context, the results are transformative."
