### Speaker Notes

"Good morning, everyone. Thank you for being here. My name is Jasper Duizendstra. For the past year, I've been on a mission to answer a question that I think many of us are wrestling with: How do we move from simply giving instructions to an AI to truly collaborating with it?

This talk, 'The AI Scrum Master,' is the story of that journey. I call it the 'AI Scrum Master' not because the AI is literally a certified Scrum Master, but because the title captures the three profound shifts in how we collaborate. It signifies working with a **team of AI personas**, not a monolith. It shows that the AI can **understand and use frameworks**. And most importantly, it frames our relationship as a partnership, where the AI's role is to **facilitate our work and remove impediments**, just like a great Scrum Master does for their team.

It's about moving past the frustration of 'prompt fatigue' and discovering a new, structured way to partner with AI to get real, high-quality work done. And I'm going to promise you two things: a new **model** for thinking about AI collaboration, and a practical **framework** for putting it into practice."
