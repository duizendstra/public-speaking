# Context window

## Using the Blueprint to Select, Not Cram

---

### Speaker Notes

"So we have these two powerful concepts: a 'shared reality' in our Git repository, and a 'recipe' for the AI in our System Prompts.

But this brings us to a practical challenge we all face: the context window. How do we fit our entire repository, our durable context, into a finite prompt?

The answer is, we don't. Trying to cram everything in is the wrong approach. The key isn't to *fill* the context window; it's to master the art of *selection*.

Think of it like a master chef. The chef has a massive pantryâ€”that's our repository. When they start cooking, they don't bring the entire pantry to their station. They use their expertise to select only the necessary ingredients for the specific dish they're making.

Our job as Orchestrators is to do the same: we must become experts at selecting the precise code, documentation, and rules the AI needs to complete the current task. But to do that selection effectively, our 'pantry' can't be a disorganized mess. It needs a clear, logical structure. A map. And we'll talk about that map in just a moment."
