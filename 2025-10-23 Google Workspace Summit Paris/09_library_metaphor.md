# Factory, Library, Product

## Our Recipe for Collaboration

---

### Speaker Notes

"This model gives the AI the blueprint to our project. It provides a clear, shared map that both of us can follow.

It knows that to understand our standards, business rules, and philosophy, it should consult the **Library**. The Library is our 'Recipe Book.'

It knows that the automation, the build scripts, and the tools for creating the final output are located in the **Factory**.

And it understands that the ultimate goal, the 'Final Dish' we are creating, is the **Product**.

This simple structure turns a confusing folder tree into a coherent map of our shared mission. It allows any partner—human or AI—to instantly understand where to find relevant context and how it contributes to the overall goal."
