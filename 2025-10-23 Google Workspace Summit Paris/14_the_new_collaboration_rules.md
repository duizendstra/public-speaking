- Focus on the 'Why,' Not the 'How.'
- Build a Single Source of Truth.
- Create Your Safety Net.

### Speaker Notes

"So, when we bring all these pieces together, we get more than a finished product. We get a new, sustainable workflow governed by a new set of rules for AI collaboration. If you take away only three things from this talk, let them be these rules.

First: **Focus on the 'Why,' Not the 'How.'** Our primary job as Orchestrators is to provide a clear, testable definition of the mission. The AI made me think about my own thinking, and that clarity is our most important contribution. We are the architects, not the builders.

Second: **Build a Single Source of Truth.** Context isn't something you paste into a prompt. A well-structured repository is the most effective tool for giving your AI partner a persistent, shared, and model-agnostic reality.

And Third: **Create Your Safety Net.** Acknowledge the AI's non-deterministic nature by using a rigorous test suite and version control to verify the final result. Trust the system you've built.

These three rules are the foundation of this new workflow. They are the practical steps for moving from prompt fatigue to a more effective partnership."
