## Build a Shared Reality

---

### Speaker Notes

"That epiphany revealed the real problem. It wasn't a lack of intelligence, but a lack of a **shared, persistent reality**. The AI has a functional memory within a session, but once it ends, that reality is gone. I was working with a partner whose memory reset every morning.

And this problem is magnified every time we want to switch tools. Moving from one AI model to another means onboarding a new partner from zero. The cost of constantly re-establishing context is the root cause of 'prompt fatigue.'

And this is the solution. The most foundational piece of our collaboration model is to give our partnership a durable, persistent context that exists outside of any single conversation or any single AI model.

In my framework, this principle is simple: we build a single source of truth. The entire Git repository becomes that shared, portable reality for our collaborationâ€”a state that *any* AI can understand."
