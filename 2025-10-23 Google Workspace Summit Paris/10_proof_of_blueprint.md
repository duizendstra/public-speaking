# [Screenshot of the time-writing Google Workspace Add-on]

### Speaker Notes

"And here is the result of this model in action. My goal was to migrate a time-writing tool from a simple Apps Script prototype into a production-grade Google Workspace Add-on using Go. This is a task that would normally take weeks.

I started on a Friday afternoon by ensuring the repository was perfectly structured. It had the **Library** with the business rules, the **Factory** with the Go build tools, and a placeholder for the **Product**.

I then gave my AI partner the mission: 'Rewrite this Apps Script prototype in Go, following the structure in this repository.'

I spent the weekend in the Orchestrator's Loop. I would **Define the What** by writing a test for a piece of functionality, **Delegate the How** to the AI, and **Verify the Result**. Over and over.

By Sunday evening, the entire application was rewritten in Go. This wasn't because of a single magic prompt. It was possible because the AI had a blueprint. It understood the mission, it knew where to find the business rules, and it knew what the final product should look like. This is the speed you can achieve when you move from prompting to true, structured collaboration."
