# (System) Prompts
## Our Recipe for Collaboration

---

### Speaker Notes

"So, we've established our single source of truthâ€”the shared reality for our collaboration. But context alone isn't enough. We also need to define the *character* of our partner and the rules of engagement for each task.

This is where we use System Prompts.

A system prompt is our recipe for the session. It defines the AI's persona, its rules, and its goal. It's how we transform a general-purpose AI into a specialized team member. Instead of just saying, 'Here are some files, write some code,' we give it a role and a purpose. For example, we'll say, 'You are Logos, our team's Strategist. Your job is to analyze these requirements and create a logical outline.'

We have a whole collective of these personas, from strategists to storytellers to documentarians. By giving the AI a specific role, a clear purpose, and the right context from our shared reality, we get a collaborator that actively contributes to the mission. This is the final piece of preparation before the work begins."
