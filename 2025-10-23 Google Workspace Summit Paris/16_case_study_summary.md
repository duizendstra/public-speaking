# Case Study Summary

## How the framework enabled the weekend rewrite

---

### Speaker Notes

"So let's bring it all together by revisiting the time-writing add-on case study. Rewriting an entire application from Apps Script to Go in a single weekend wasn't the result of a single, clever prompt. It was the result of applying this framework.

It was possible because the AI had **Context**: the original Apps Script prototype stored in our Git repository, our shared reality.

It was possible because it understood our **Mental Model**: the 'Factory, Library, Product' structure for the new production-grade add-on.

And we could move that fast because we had **Guardrails**: a test suite that verified each piece of migrated logic, all managed through a professional workflow with tools like `clasp`.

This isn't a magic trick. It's the result of a methodical, structured approach to collaboration. It is the framework for an effective partnership."
