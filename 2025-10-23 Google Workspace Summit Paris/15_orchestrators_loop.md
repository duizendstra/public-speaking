# The Orchestrator's Loop

---

### Speaker Notes

"So we've seen the framework. But what is the actual, day-to-day process that makes it work? It's this: **The Orchestrator's Loop.** This is our new workflow in action. It's a simple, powerful, and repeatable cycle with three steps.

First, we **Define the 'What.'** As the Orchestrator, my job is to define a clear, verifiable outcome. For a developer, this is often a failing test that acts as a precise 'definition of done.'

Second, we **Delegate the 'How.'** We pass that test, along with the relevant context from our repository, to our AI partner and ask it to achieve the defined outcome.

And third, we **Verify the Result.** Our automated guardrails—our test suite—run the check. Or, for tasks that aren't easily automated, we perform a 'human-in-the-loop' review of the changes in a `git diff`. This gives us the confidence we need to trust the work of our non-deterministic partner.

And then the loop repeats. This isn't a complex strategy. It's the methodical repetition of this simple loop that allows us to build high-quality projects at an incredible speed."
