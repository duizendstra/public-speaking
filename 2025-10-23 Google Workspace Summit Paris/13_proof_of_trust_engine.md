### Speaker Notes

"So, how did we build this safety net in a Workspace project? We used the tools that professional developers use every day: Git and a test suite.

Our entire Apps Script project was managed in a Git repository. This gave us our single source of truth and our ability to roll back. We used `clasp`, the command-line tool, to sync our local code with the Apps Script editor, giving us the best of both worlds: a real development environment and the familiar script editor.

This screenshot shows our Trust Engine in practice. This automated check, stored in our Git repository, is our guardrail. It's what allowed me to confidently delegate the migration of this logic to the AI.

I would define the 'what' with a test, the AI would generate the 'how' in the new language, and our test suite would verify the result. This is the system that makes it safe to collaborate with a non-deterministic partner. It's not about blind trust; it's about verifiable results managed in a professional development workflow."
