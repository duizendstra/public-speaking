# "Give me six hours to chop down a tree and I will spend the first four sharpening the axe."

### Speaker Notes

"Abraham Lincoln's advice about sharpening the axe has always been a core principle for developers. We spend years mastering our tools. Then, generative AI arrived. It felt like a magic chainsaw. But I quickly fell into a cycle I call 'prompt fatigue.' I was spending hours trying to describe the perfect cut, only for the AI to misunderstand.

The breakthrough came when I tried a radical experiment. Instead of trying to give the AI the perfect instructions, I decided to reverse our roles. I told it: 'You are the lead. You need to understand this project. **Interview me.**'

And what happened next was astonishing. As it asked about the user, the goal, the business purpose... a profound realization hit me. To answer the AI's questions, *I* had to think about my project with more clarity than ever before. It wasn't just building its own mental model; it was forcing me to perfect mine. The AI was making me think.

That was the epiphany. The AI didn't need a better prompt from me. It needed a shared understanding of the mission, and the agency to help build that understanding itself. That's when I knew I wasn't just using a tool; I was building a partner."
