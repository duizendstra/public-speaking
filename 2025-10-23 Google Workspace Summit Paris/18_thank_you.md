### Speaker Notes

"The speed we achieved that weekend wasn't the real story. The real story is that this new way of working frees us from the tedious 'how' and allows us, as developers and creators, to focus on the strategic 'what' and the profound 'why.'

The true superpower of this partnership isn't artificial intelligence. It's the way it challenges, sharpens, and elevates our own. The AI makes us think.

Thank you very much for your time and attention. If you're interested in exploring this framework further, this QR code will take you to a resources page with links to the articles and tools we've discussed today.

I'd like to thank the organizers of the Google Workspace Developer Summit, and I'd now be happy to answer any questions you may have."
