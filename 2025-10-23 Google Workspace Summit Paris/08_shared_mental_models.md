# Shared Mental Models

## Give Your Project a Blueprint

---

### Speaker Notes

"So, we've established that we need to give our AI partner context by building a single source of truth. But as I hinted at a moment ago, just dumping a thousand files on a partner isn't helpful. That's not a shared reality; it's a data swamp.

For context to be useful, it needs a structure—a shared map. And that brings us to the second piece of our framework: **Shared Mental Models.**

A mental model is a shared language for how we organize our project. It's the organizing principle that allows both us and our AI partner to navigate the repository and understand the purpose of every file.

After a lot of refinement, I've settled on a simple but powerful one: **Factory, Library, and Product.** This is the core organizing principle for our entire collaboration—it's the blueprint for our project."
