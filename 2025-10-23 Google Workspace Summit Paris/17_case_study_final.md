# [Screenshot of the time-writing Google Workspace Add-on]

### Speaker Notes

"So let's bring it all together with the story of the time-writing add-on. My goal was to migrate this tool from a simple Apps Script prototype into a production-grade Google Workspace Add-on using Go. This is a task that would normally take weeks.

I started on a Friday afternoon by applying this entire framework.

First, the AI had **Context**: the original Apps Script prototype was in our Git repository, our shared reality.

Second, it understood our **Mental Model**: the 'Factory, Library, Product' structure for the new production-grade add-on.

And third, we had our **Trust Engine**: a test suite that acted as our guardrails for every piece of migrated logic.

I then spent the weekend in the Orchestrator's Loop. I would **Define the What** with a test, **Delegate the How** to my AI partner, and **Verify the Result**. Over and over.

By Sunday evening, the entire application was rewritten in Go. This wasn't a magic trick. It's the result of a methodical, structured partnership. This is the speed and quality you can achieve when you move beyond prompting to true collaboration."
