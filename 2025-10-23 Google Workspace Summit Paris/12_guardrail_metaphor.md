# Guardrails

## Enabling speed and safety in a non-deterministic world

---

### Speaker Notes

"And it's important to think of these tests and automated checks as **guardrails**, not as a straitjacket.

Guardrails don't tell you how to drive. They don't restrict your creativity or your speed. They just keep you safe.

They give you the confidence to move faster, knowing that you have a system in place to prevent you from going over the edge.

This is what makes the partnership with a non-deterministic AI both safe and effective. It's not about blind trust; it's about building a system that makes trust verifiable."
