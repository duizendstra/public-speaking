# Building the Trust Engine

## Create Your Safety Net

---

### Speaker Notes

"That result from the weekend is impressive, but it raises a critical question that every developer in this room should be asking: How do we *trust* a partner that is non-deterministic?

This brings us to the third and final piece of our framework: **Building the Trust Engine.**

To work effectively at high speed with a non-deterministic system, we need a safety net. In our framework, that safety net is built on two core developer practices we already use every day: **Test-Driven Development** and **version control**.

The process is simple. My job, as the Orchestrator, is to write a test that defines the 'what.' The AI's job is to generate the code that makes the test pass. The test suite acts as our impartial, automated judge, and our Git history provides the ability to roll back at any time.

This system is what gives us the confidence to delegate complex work to our AI partner."
